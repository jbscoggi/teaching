    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will learn how to use decision trees and ensemble methods to build a model that predicts the average price of houses for neighborhoods in the US state of California.  We will make heavy use of the following libraries to play with the dataset and build our models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - python data analysis library\n",
    "- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - python machine learning library\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the lecture that decision trees can be a powerful way to generate cheap and efficient models for classification and regression.  Some of the advantages of decision trees over other models include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are easy to use, requiring little data preprocessing,\n",
    "- Can be easily interpreted,\n",
    "- Are useful for feature selection,\n",
    "- Fast to build and evaluate,\n",
    "- Non-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, some of the disadvantages include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Greedy tree building algorithms are not necessarily optimal (this is NP-complete),\n",
    "- The number of samples is logarithmic in tree depth,\n",
    "- Trees are unstable, meaning they can be easily perturbed with small differences in data,\n",
    "- Decision trees are excellent overfitters,\n",
    "- Since they only consider a single feature at a time, they have difficulty handling model additivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, it decision trees can be poor classifiers or regressors.  However, because of their fast training speed, they can be used to generate ensemble models, such as random forests, with boosting and bagging.  We will play with some of these concepts during this lab in order to compare to basic decision tree performance.  Before we get started, let's import and load the different packages we will use.\n",
